# Service

Custom service should extend `Service` class available as named export from `@advertol/core` package.

Letâ€™s create service which will populate zone DOM nodes with content inside object passed on instantiation.

```js
import advertol, { Service } from '@advertol/core';

class ContentService extends Service {

	constructor ( content ) {
		super();
		this.content = content;
	}

	writeZone ({ element, id }) {

		return new Promise(( resolve, reject ) => {

			// Get zone content from initial object
			const content = this.content[id];

			// Check for empty state
			if ( content === '' ) {
				element.innerHTML = content;
				resolve(false);
				return;
			}

			element.innerHTML = content;
			resolve(true);

		});

	}

}

const instance = advertol({
	// Other options ommited for clarity
	service: [
		new ContentService({
			becky: 'Becky content'
		})
	]
});

instance.resolve();
```
